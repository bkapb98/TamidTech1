# Tamid Tech 10/9

Today we will start exploring Node.JS, a popular and powerful tool for executing JavaScript on the server side.  Since the Autofleet stack is based primarily on Node, it will be crucial for everyone to have a good understanding of the fundamentals. We are giving some code for the server which hopefully should be easy to understand of just creating a server. We also are including a basic html page so you will be able to see the results. Feel free to take a look at the code and try and get started by making a developer account for twitter, getting your own api keys and trying to fill our the table with your own tweets. If you guys have any trouble we will work on it in our meeting on Tuesday. 

## Getting started
Go to https://developer.twitter.com/ and make a developer account.

## Overview
We will build a simple webpage based on the Twitter API: 
1. It should display on the homepage '/' the top 5 tweets from around the world
2. Onclick of one of these tweets it should search the user and display that individual user / organizations past five tweets. It should also display basic information about the user.
3. Lastly, enable a user to add comments on the homepage and save them locally.
